This role in particular will be primarily focused on sales and operations, which means working on things like building and scheduling automated reports in Looker, designing impactful internal-facing dashboards to drive insight and efficiency, onboarding recently acquired data sources through knowledge-building and SQL-based data modeling, supporting the development of a new customer-facing reporting portal, and more.

Buying a home should be an exciting milestone. But all too often, it's stressful, especially in a competitive market or when you're buying and selling at the same time. So we're redesigning the homebuying experience. We're a fast-paced real estate startup that empowers agents to help homebuyers buy with cash. We buy homes on behalf of our partners' clients with our cash, then the... client buys the home back from us.

Founder and CEO Tim Heyl, a 10-year industry veteran and owner of one of the fastest-growing agent teams in the country, started Homeward in 2018. In fact, he bought our first customer's home with his own life savings. Today we offer two services — Buy with cash and Buy before you sell.

We've raised more than $160MM in equity capital from top-tier venture investors, including Norwest, Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, Adams Street, Javelin, and LiveOak. Our leadership team includes experts from the real estate, mortgage, and technology industries.

In this role you will:
• Report to our Head of Business Analytics and partner with stakeholders to develop a business analytics roadmap for improving the company wide availability, speed and quality of data/analysis that accelerates decision making
• Provide innovative analytical insight, supporting various functions across Homeward

• Be data subject matter expert for company's OKR roadmaps & guiding teams to metrics, data points, and outcomes
• Launch a training program to introduce new team members to data at Homeward with the goal of empowering and upskilling members of all internal teams to serve up their own data and insights
• Support development, maintenance and organization of performance reporting and management dashboards for all of Homeward's functional areas of operations and optimizations

What you'll bring:
• 5+ years of proven experience in business analytics, business intelligence or comparable role; preference for experience within high-growth startups and/or top-tier mgmt consulting
• Experience creating, maintaining, supporting metrics within a BI tool (Mode, Looker, Tableau preferred)

• Demonstrated ability to synthesize independently generated data points into a cohesive analysis, and clearly communicate the results of complex analyses to a wide audience in a credible fashion

• Excellent interpersonal skills and have experience working directly with senior leadership

Our Values

THE GOLDEN RULE

Whether we're dealing with colleagues or customers, we follow The Golden Rule, treating others the way we want to be treated. It's a simple rule, but it's also significant: we don't prioritize money or growth over people, and we practice empathy at every opportunity.

CALM FOCUS

We work in tech and build solutions for real estate. Both are fast-paced and stressful industries. So it's important that we focus on the larger objective rather than rushing from one task to the next. If something is out of scope, we say ""No."" If something feels rushed, we pump the brakes. This calm focus helps us create solutions our customers love.

ONE TEAM, ONE DREAM

Big problems require big solutions. We look at our customers' experience holistically, and recognize that solving them requires collaboration across teams. This approach extends to cooperation among our three affiliate companies — Homeward, Homeward Mortgage and Homeward Title — and produces a more integrated homebuying experience",,"['24 min', 'Full-time', 'No degree mentioned']","{'schedule_type': 'Full-time', 'commute_time': '24 min'}",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,78738,none,none,-1,-1,none,none,none,4.2,32,none,https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Homeward-Reviews-E2532761.htm?utm_campaign=google_jobs_reviews&utm_source=google_jobs_reviews&utm_medium=organic,https://boards.greenhouse.io/homeward/jobs/5911158002?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,Apply on Greenhouse,none,Glassdoor

87,Executive Assistant,Sana benefits,"Austin, TX, United States",via Vabiso,"Our health system is broken, and it’s a huge problem. Costs are rising out of control while the patient experience gets worse. At Sana, we're passionate about fixing this problem by bringing accessible and affordable health plans to small and medium businesses. We've built an innovative team with top talent from across the health insurance and tech industries to create engaging, modern plans for... our clients. This allows our customers to offer competitive benefits packages while paying an average of 20% less than traditional plans.

Sana is seeking a motivated, highly organized, trustworthy, and experienced executive assistant to work and grow alongside Sana’s CEO and our high performance executive team. Our company has grown from 30 people to 80 people in the last year; fast growth brings with it a lot of competing priorities. Your job is to free up more of the CEO’s time and provide the executive team leverage so we can be more impactful as an organization.

In this role, your time will be split:

40% supporting CEO with business admin tasks

40% directly supporting the executive team and business at large

20% helping manage tasks in the CEO’s personal life

What you will do

Keep the CEO focused on the most important initiatives for the business - setting weekly priorities together, proactively managing calendar and communications to make sure the most important tasks get accomplished

Triage CEO’s correspondence, primarily over email and slack, building an understanding of what messages should be prioritized (news, investor outreach, services, etc) so you can be an effective filter and eventually handle a substantial amount of the correspondence yourself

Proactively manage the CEO’s time - booking meetings and appointments, planning travel, and taking other administrative tasks off his plate

Own executive team functions such as coordinating our weekly All Hands meetings, setting agendas and note-taking with our weekly department head meetings, collecting and disseminating status updates on company goals (OKRs), etc.

Manage occasional HR and office tasks like collecting laptops from departing employees, coordinating logistics around team gatherings and finding vendors to provide one-off services for our office

Assist with miscellaneous personal tasks, including finding residential contractors, coordinating with nannies/daycare, researching gifts, setting doctor & vet appointments, etc. The CEO has a newborn daughter, a dog, and a house - responsibilities he shares with his wife who is also a busy startup executive. Taking some of these tasks off of his plate can be a big time saver.

About you

3+ years of experience as an EA or in a similar administrative function

Austin resident preferred, but full remote is possible for the right candidateExcellent communication skills - verbal and written

Extremely organized and 100% reliableExcited about entrepreneurship and business in general. It’s ok if you don’t want to be an EA forever.

Fast learner. You adapt to new situations, processes, domains of knowledge quickly.

High level computer proficiency, including familiarity with tools like Google Apps, Slack, and Zoom

Comfortable working from home - we have an office in South Austin, but half of our company is remote; the CEO works from home often and you will have the option to work remotely most of the time if you prefer

You can maintain confidentiality and use a high degree of discretion. You'll have visibility into a lot of business & personal life details.

Pass a background check (ie no criminal history)

• Noise level. It can get noisy at times. We provide hearing protection if you need it.
• Dress code. Relaxed, with a few rules to follow for safety. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are required. Depending on the role or location, Amazon provides a $110 Zappos gift code towards the purchase of shoes, in order to have you prepared for your first day on the job.

• Temperature. Even with climate controls, temperatures can vary between 60°F and 90°F in some parts of the warehouse; on hot days, temperatures can be over 90°F in the truck yard or inside trailers.
• Noise level. It can get noisy at times. We provide hearing protection if you need it.
• Dress code. Relaxed, with a few rules to follow for safety. Comfortable, closed-toe shoes are required. Depending on the role or location, Amazon provides a $110 Zappos gift code towards the purchase of shoes, in order to have you prepared for your first day on the job.
Why You'll Love this Job

• Shift flexibility. Work when it works for you. Shifts may include overnight, early morning, day, evening, and weekend. You can even have four-day workweeks, three-day weekends - and with Anytime Shifts , you can work as little as four hours per week.

• Career advancement. We have made a pledge to upskill our employees and offer a variety of free training and development programs, and we also have tuition support options for select employee groups. See where your Amazon journey can take you.
